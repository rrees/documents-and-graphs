# Did you really need a graph? #

!SLIDE bullets

# For simple questions? No #

* For simple implementations graphs, searches and map-reduce are interchangeable
* Depth one queries are probably better served this way

#When your question is more complex: yes#

* Graphs become more powerful when you are looking beyond the first relationship
* As interactions and actors increase relating things gets harder

# Resistance is futile #

* No-one store model solves all problems

# We would always have a polygot solution #

* Ease of maintenance
* Text search
* Adhoc performant queries
* Rapidly changing data model

# Strategical positioning #

* Addressing questions to our entire dataset
* Without making our multitenancy story complex
* We need a meta-database store

# Take it to the limits #

* We pushed our document store

# But no further #

* Replicating functionality in unsympathetic systems is the ultimate hack
* It has nothing to do with *ideas*
